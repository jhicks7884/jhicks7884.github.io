First off to know how fa r back the love of science goes,
Love how everything works together in unison otherwise it breaks
Just like in programming. 

People steadily Looking around wondering key topics in there mind 
of how and why this works but something else didnt, kinda 
how for the last few weeks sitting at my computer reading and doing research 
and reading articles and writing code to see were itll lead me.

Man for the first few minutes siiting at a blank canvas, waiting for the painter
to paint or make his masterpiece . Ironicly inded up staring at my screen for days 
until the first few strokes of my keyboard.

Had a dummy CLI (Command Line Interface) working
then added my make shift data until i grabbed it from a working web page 
great feeling of accomplishment to say the least....

although sitting and running it over and over again , started noticeing i can alter it and better functions 
to the piece, to kinda name a few,

1. have program offer greetings
2. Have program learn a name and offer a responce greeting.
3. user selection
4. give details on selection from user
5. give title to the article 
6. and provide and salutation

Learned a great deal on how to set up and organize code to were it makes since, and the final result is
a working web scraper with a User friendly CLI(Command Line Interface).
