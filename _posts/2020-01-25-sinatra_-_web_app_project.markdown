 As a beginner programmer this was a great expierence from debugging to truly expierence the 
 power of errors and issues.
 wich makes for a great techy (programming) tool to learn from.
 
 As when shotgun stopped showing my get routes and error messages, in order to get things back to normal had to change the port by using command,  shotgun -p 4240 and it'll start producing your routes again if it had stopped. and thats how to get shotgun to operate as it should after failure.
