ok so the rails framework is pretty cool, so much you can do with it from
generating a whole application to a scratch build. to generate specific pieces as needed just by using the (rails generate) functions.
following CRUD, and Restful conventions and keep your code dry and dont repeat.....
C-reate
R-ead
U-pdate
D-elete

seemingly be able to run a server to test out your code and find out what error you get or if theres no errors 
and the app runs smoothly.....

Happy coding.
