The beginning 


      learning programming skills  with a constructor brain.....
       were nothing works on paper but everything works in reality
         turning my tools from hammers and basic power tools 
                   to my finger tips and building a problem solving brain
                        with basic questions that ive been confronted with
 
                             usually starts with " why " 
                                and  ends  with "Why"
 
 
                                     learning the different commands and the order                                      they go in
                                       from the pieces of conversation you write into                                                the   interface
                                        to get the solution and or desired outcome                                                          from  the programs you write.
